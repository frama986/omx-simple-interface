###A simple interface for OMXPlayer written in Python

This is my first Phyton project and i decided to share it with everyone.
I created this simple interface for OMXPlayer as a case study to learn Python and, obviously, to semplify the selection of videos.

#####Requirement
* This application is written for Phyton 3.4
* OMXPlayer ([https://github.com/huceke/omxplayer](huceke/omxplayer))
* Assign the write permissions to the project folder: the application has to create the recent videos' file.


#####Start the application
Launch osiMain.py file:

`./osiMain`

or

`python3 osiMain.py`
